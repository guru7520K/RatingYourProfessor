when does the uuid gets generated ?

The UUID gets generated automatically when a new Rating object is created. Specifically, in the Rating model, the default value for the user_id field is set to uuid.uuid4, which is a function that generates a random UUID.

When a new Rating object is created, the user_id field is automatically populated with a new UUID generated by this function. So, every time a new rating is added to the database, a new UUID is generated for the user_id field.

how does do it know if this user has already given a rating to this professor or not
In the professor_detail view, when a POST request is received, the user's user_id and the professor object are used to query the Rating model using the get() method. If the query returns a Rating object, it means that the user has already given a rating to the professor, and the existing rating object is updated with the new rating. If the query raises a Rating.DoesNotExist exception, it means that the user has not yet rated the professor, and a new Rating object is created with the user's user_id, the professor object, and the new rating value.

 class Meta:
        unique_together = ('rating ', 'user_id')  if we use this instead why doesn't work

If you use unique_together = ('rating', 'user_id') in the Rating model's Meta class, it should enforce a unique constraint on the rating and user_id fields together, meaning that each combination of a rating and a user ID should be unique in the database. This would prevent multiple ratings from the same user for the same professor, which is what we want.

However, it seems that there is a typo in your code where there is an extra space after 'rating ' in the unique_together tuple. This would cause the rating field to be interpreted as 'rating ' (with a trailing space) which is not the same as 'rating', so the unique constraint would not work as expected.
