f user directly visits add_rating url without logging in and submit a rating ? i get IntegrityError at /professor/1/add_rating/
NOT NULL constraint failed: ratingprofessor_rating.user_id why i that
The error "IntegrityError at /professor/1/add_rating/ NOT NULL constraint failed: ratingprofessor_rating.user_id" occurs 
When a user tries to submit a rating without logging in, the request.user.id value will be None, because there is no authenticated user. As a result, when the add_rating view tries to create a new Rating object with the user_id field set to None,
it violates the NOT NULL constraint, causing the IntegrityError to be raised,

  if request.method == 'POST':
        user_id = request.user.id  
        
  When a user signs up for an account using Django's built-in authentication system or is added to the database through some other means, Django automatically assigns a unique id to the user record in the database. 
  This id is an auto-incrementing integer, and it serves as the primary key for the user record in the database.







because the user_id field in the Rating model 
is set to default=uuid.uuid4 and editable=False,
meaning that it is generated automatically and cannot be edited by the user. 
However, in the add_rating view, when a user is not logged in and tries to submit a rating, the user_id field is not being set, 
and the default uuid.uuid4 value is not being generated, causing the NOT NULL constraint to fail when trying to save the Rating instance.
