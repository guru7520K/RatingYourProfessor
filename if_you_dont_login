IntegrityError at /professor/4/add_rating/
NOT NULL constraint failed: ratingprofessor_rating.user_id
 getting this error when i dont log in or register
This error indicates that the user_id field in the Rating model is set to null=False, meaning that it cannot be left blank or null when creating a new rating object in the database. However, when a user who is not logged in or registered tries to give a rating, the user_id field is not being set correctly, which is causing this error.

To fix this error, you need to make sure that the user_id is set correctly before saving the rating object in the database. Since the user is not logged in or registered, you can assign a random unique identifier to the user_id field using the uuid module, like this:

python
Copy code
import uuid

def add_rating(request, professor_id):
    professor = Professor.objects.get(id=professor_id)

    if request.method == 'POST':
        user_id = str(uuid.uuid4())  # generate a random unique identifier for the user
        try:
            existing_rating = Rating.objects.get(user_id=user_id, professor=professor)
            form = RatingForm(request.POST, instance=existing_rating)
        except Rating.DoesNotExist:
            form = RatingForm(request.POST)

        if form.is_valid():
            rating = form.save(commit=False)
            rating.user_id = user_id
            rating.professor = professor
            rating.save()
            return redirect('professor_detail', professor_id=professor_id)
    else:
        form = RatingForm()

    return render(request, 'add_rating.html', {'form': form, 'professor': professor})
With this modification, a random unique identifier will be generated for the user who is not logged in or registered, and this identifier will be associated with the rating object in the database.
