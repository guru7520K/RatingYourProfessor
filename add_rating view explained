      if request.method == 'POST':
        user_id = request.user.id   the user is logged in, user_id will be set to the id of the logged-in user,
        which will be used to create or update a rating for the logged-in user and the professor they are rating.
        The id of the logged-in user is generated automatically by Django when a new user is created in the database.

When a user signs up for an account using Django's built-in authentication system or is added to the database through some other means, 
Django automatically assigns a unique id to the user record in the database. 
This id is an auto-incrementing integer, and it serves as the primary key for the user record in the database.
when a user logs in to their account, Django retrieves the user record from the database and stores it in the request.user attribute. 
The id of the user is already present in the user record, so it can be accessed as request.user.id as shown in the code.
 

how does save() know with model class to associate when save() is used
When the save() method is used in Django, it knows which model class to associate based on the instance that the method is called on. 
For example, in the create_professor view, the form.save() method is called on the ProfessorForm instance, so it knows to create a new instance of the Professor model class and save it to the database.

In the add_rating view, the form.save() method is called on the RatingForm instance, 
so it knows to create a new instance of the Rating model class and save it to the database. The commit=False argument tells the save() method to create a new instance of the Rating model class but not save it to the database yet,
so that additional fields (in this case, user_id and professor) can be added before the final save.













let me explain what this Django view function add_rating() does.

The purpose of this view is to handle the submission of a rating form for a specific professor. It takes a professor_id as input, which is used to retrieve the corresponding Professor object from the database.

The view checks if the request method is POST, which indicates that the user has submitted the rating form. If the method is POST, it tries to retrieve an existing Rating object for the current user and professor using the get() method of the Rating model. If an existing rating is found, the form is initialized with the existing rating data using the instance parameter of the RatingForm constructor. Otherwise, a new form is created using the request.POST data.

If the form is valid, a new Rating object is created using the form.save(commit=False) method, which creates a new Rating object in memory but doesn't save it to the database yet. The user_id and professor fields are then set on the new Rating object, and the object is saved to the database using the save() method.

If the method is not POST, which means the user has not yet submitted the form, a new empty form is created.

Finally, the view renders a template called add_rating.html, passing it the form and professor objects as context.

In summary, this view handles the submission of a rating form for a specific professor, either creating a new rating object or updating an existing one, and redirects the user to the professor detail page after the rating is saved.
