let me explain what this Django view function add_rating() does.

The purpose of this view is to handle the submission of a rating form for a specific professor. It takes a professor_id as input, which is used to retrieve the corresponding Professor object from the database.

The view checks if the request method is POST, which indicates that the user has submitted the rating form. If the method is POST, it tries to retrieve an existing Rating object for the current user and professor using the get() method of the Rating model. If an existing rating is found, the form is initialized with the existing rating data using the instance parameter of the RatingForm constructor. Otherwise, a new form is created using the request.POST data.

If the form is valid, a new Rating object is created using the form.save(commit=False) method, which creates a new Rating object in memory but doesn't save it to the database yet. The user_id and professor fields are then set on the new Rating object, and the object is saved to the database using the save() method.

If the method is not POST, which means the user has not yet submitted the form, a new empty form is created.

Finally, the view renders a template called add_rating.html, passing it the form and professor objects as context.

In summary, this view handles the submission of a rating form for a specific professor, either creating a new rating object or updating an existing one, and redirects the user to the professor detail page after the rating is saved.
